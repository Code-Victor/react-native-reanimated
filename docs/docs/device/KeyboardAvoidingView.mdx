# KeyboardAvoidingView

`KeyboardAvoidingView` is Reanimated's implementation of [React Native's KeyboardAvoidingView](https://reactnative.dev/docs/keyboardavoidingview). It uses [useAnimatedKeyboard](/docs/device/useAnimatedKeyboard) hook so that it is possible to animate things based on the keyboard state in the same frame.

## Reference

```javascript
import Animated from 'react-native-reanimated';

function App() {
  return (
    // highlight-next-line
    <Animated.KeyboardAvoidingView>
      // views that need to be moved out of the way of the keyboard //
      highlight-next-line
    </Animated.KeyboardAvoidingView>
  );
}
```

### Props

#### `View Props`

Inherits [View Props](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view#props).

#### `behavior`

A string specifying how the view achieves its goal. Takes one of the following values: `('height', 'position', 'padding')`. Works adequately to [React Native's behavior prop](https://reactnative.dev/docs/keyboardavoidingview#behavior):

- `height` behavior changes component's height if needed

- `position` behavior moves the component upwards relatively to other components

- `padding` behavior adds corresponding padding to the component, effectively moving its content inside its frame

#### `contentContainerStyle`

The style of the content container (View) when behavior is `position`. Works the same way as [React Native's corresponding prop](https://reactnative.dev/docs/keyboardavoidingview#contentcontainerstyle).

#### `enabled`

A boolean that decides whether the component is enabled or not, `true` by default.

## Remarks

- Reanimated's `KeyboardAvoidingView` calculations already take views above the component into account, so the confusing [keyboardVerticalOffset](https://reactnative.dev/docs/keyboardavoidingview#keyboardverticaloffset) prop from React Native is not needed.

- The component works properly with any navigation stack from [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/).

- The previous point also holds true for `SafeAreaView` (either from [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/safeareaview) or [react-native-safe-area-context](https://github.com/th3rdwave/react-native-safe-area-context)) and for views not confined to any safe area or navigation.
